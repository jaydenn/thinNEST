# thinNEST
A lightweight and flexible code for running NEST simulations. thinNEST is modelled off the testNEST code, but with a few added features: 
- simulate arbitrary spectra supplied via an input file
- optional inclusion of the migdal effect
- optional calculation of the s2-width (requires modified nest source)
- changable detector and analysis parameters

With the goal of running fast and without having to re-compile to change options.
